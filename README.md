# testfwk

"Hello World" is a traditional start for learning a new language. For TDDers, the equivalent is surely to write a test framework.

## Usage

For clojure I started with:

(spec "A Spec describes expected behaviour")    

which (until my computer can read english and clojure) I confirm by manual inspection: The spec does indeed describe it's expected behaviour).

So I went straight on to

(spec "A Spec runs its body") 

which took me about a day to do. But I learned some stuff about vim, fireplace, paredit, and clojure macros along the way.
